# Object-Detector



#### Install Tensorflow,OpenCV(Manual Installation for GPU access otherwise use pip if you want to do it on CPU)

#### Download YOLOv3-416 weights file from here: https://pjreddie.com/darknet/yolo/

#### Now make a folder yolo-coco folder in the working directory and place the above weights file along with yolov3.cfg and coco.names files in this folder

#### Make sure you use the above folder name only otherwise you would have to change the path to model in both object_detection.py and object_detection_image.py
