# Object-Detector
###  The Object Detector uses YOLOv3 model trained on COCO Dataset.In case you want to train the model on your own you need to have Darknet in your system.Darknet is a framework to train neural networks, it is open source and written in C/CUDA and serves as the basis for YOLO.
###  It is fast, easy to install, and supports CPU and GPU computation
###  Keep all the downloaded files in same working directory
###  Execute object_detector.py or object_detector_image.py from terminal or command line
###  Use following command line arguments:
 #####    --input:to input your image or video file to detect objects in it  
 #####    --output:to save your output file after object detection by the model with same same format as of input.Prefer video file is saved as .avi

 ##### --display 0:if you don't want to see object detection in your input in real time
